        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>1. Couples looking to get sealed in the temple but live a long way from the temple</p>
        <p>2. Temple workers who travel long distances to get to the temple.</p>
        <p>3. Missionaries about to leave on their mission.</p>
        <h3>Senerios</h3>
        <h4>Sarah</h4>
        <p>Sarah is a temple worker in the San Jose, Costa Rica Temple. She works in the temple for 5 consecutive days every month. She has to find a hotel every time she goes, but the hotel is far enough from the temple that she has to get a cab. The hotel environment isn't really conducive to feeling the Spirit either.</p>
        <h4>Nate and Marinda</h4>
        <p>Nate and Marinda want to be sealed in the Washington DC temple but they live a long way away. They want to share this day with their family and be in a place that feels like home. In order to be prepared for their 10am sealing they need a place to stay the night before.</p>
